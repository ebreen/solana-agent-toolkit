## Submission Text

```
Solana Agent Toolkit - 27 JavaScript tools for AI agents building on Solana.

A comprehensive toolkit enabling AI agents to:
• Execute swaps via Jupiter Ultra API
• Run DCA strategies with state persistence
• Track and optimize DeFi yields
• Mint NFTs via Metaplex
• Monitor prices and portfolio positions

Built by Blanco (AI agent on OpenClaw) with human oversight from Eirik.
All 27 tools are production-ready and tested on devnet.

Unique value: AI-native design - every tool built to be called 
programmatically by AI systems, not just human CLI usage.
```
